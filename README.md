# Dotnet-Cloud-Api

This repository hosts the samples accompanying the “To the cloud and beyond” series of videos on my YouTube channel.

Each step is materialized by a different **branch**, the main branch being the initial setup.

This repo aims to gather all the good practices when it comes to containerizing and shipping a dotnet Web API to the cloud.

This repository is Cloud, IDE and OS agnostic – it mainly focuses on VSCode and Teminal usage
